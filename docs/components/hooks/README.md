# Hooks

## Guide

::: warning
Hooks are still in alpha
:::

`vue-chart-3` also provides fully typed hooks compatible with Vue 2 and Vue 3 using `vue-demi`.

They are not mandatory, but they simplify the usage of chart components.

Each component has its corresponding hooks. Ex: `Barchart` will have `useBarChart`.

## Usage

Using the `useXXXChart` will clean up your code as it provides a shortcut for props and ref

Declaring it give you access to `xxxChartProps` and `xxxChartRef`.

For `BarChart` you can import `useBarChart` from `vue-chart-3` and use it like this

```ts
const { barChartProps, barChartRef } = useBarChart({
  chartData: {}, //...
});
```

Then you can use the `barChartProps` to fill the props of the component

```html
<BarChart v-bind="barChartProps" />
```
