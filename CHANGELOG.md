# 3.0.0 and 2.0.0 (2021-11-23)

- Breaking changes and new versions numbers

In previous versions, `vue-demi` was used. It worked really well, but as the project advanced, they were a lot of problems with vue-related typescript definitions, tests and conflict between dependencies.

This new system will keep `vue-chart-3` working for both Vue 2 & 3 with designated versions (`2.x` and `3.x` respectively), but each one designed for their specific Vue version.

The usage of components of hooks is unchanged for both versions.

Code wise, there is not big breaking changes. But the Vue 3 version will have improved type checking for components template (with Volar extension).
